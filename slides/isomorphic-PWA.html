                        - Why PWA
                        - Be ready with service workers

                        ## Background
                        Before service workers, client app concept was on MV* client libraries
                        such as Backbone, React, Angular etc. But all of them, works with same script, and not reloading page.

                        - Fist load, for all dependencies taking good chunk of time.
                        - By adding more functionality, app becomes slower.
                        - Not the best for mobile.

                        For some application parts to use some frameworks still very useful, but not necessary to use on all pages in app.
                        Since service workers and http2 protocol are available, app can work in offline mode, also native es6 javascript
                        makes coding easier.

                        With correct client side handling reload entire page, taking so short time 50-100ms, sometimes even less.
                        Means there, for different page functionality, not necessary to keep single page app concept.

                        There is also another advantage, because each page has small functionality,
                        You can easy migrate from one framework to another, without big impact in environment, or even use multiple frameworks in same app.

                        Good example is Angular 1,2,4 all of them are not backwards compatible, more complex you have app, more difficult is to migrate.

                        ## Why PWA (Progressive Web App)
                        ### Key points from Chrome developers:

                        **Reliable** - Load instantly and never show the dinosaur, even in uncertain network conditions.

                        **Fast** - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.

                        **Engaging** - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.

                        Each page has some small concrete functionality, and easy intuitive navigation.

                        ## Be ready with service workers

                        By using service workers, you can catch all fetch events, and use network requests, only for necessary tasks.

                        App still usable, with no internet connection at all. With Service Worker app cache, you can store all static assets on client.

                        Also there is another advantage, browsers who still not have a service worker support, will handle fetch by server.

                        ## Firebase as hosting and Server side handling

                        Firebase is very useful, to use as web hosting. They provide Authentication, hosting for static assets, and cloud functions.
                        In cloud functions have full `Nodejs` environment, and working with `Express` API.

                        Not for all projects Firebase fully fit in to requirements, but in those projects can use same practice.

                        Server side still supporting, browsers with no service workers.
                        And because `Nodejs` and `FIrebase-functions` working on javascript, we use same isomorphic approach for code,
                        `Nodejs` and  `service workers` will use same code base, and fetch/request we handle true adapters.

                        ## Server Side Rendering

                        For server side rendering, we can't use only `Express`. There important is
                        to use same code in `service workers`, and `Express` are not built for client apps.
                        For isomporphic app handling, we created few utilities.

                        - For asynchronous code composition [https://github.com/gunins/functional](https://github.com/gunins/functional).
                        - For route handling [https://github.com/gunins/service-worker-router](https://github.com/gunins/service-worker-router).
                        Router, we use on top of `Express` on back end, on `service worker` with simple adapter.

                        Both of those utilities we will review in next slides.

                        ## Client Side Rendering

                        For client side rendering, we catching all fetch events. Inside with router, described in previous slide,
                        we filtering route, if route exists in path, we respond local data, if not, passing data to network.

                        Service Worker is fast, and no need network request for page rendering.

                        By using fetch event we catch all network requests, and return custom response, for static assets respond from app cache,
                        for custom pages render inside Service Worker, and if necessary fetch only required data via REST API, or load from local indexedDB.
                        By using this approach full page reload will be extremely fast. Sometimes even faster than single page app.

                        ## Authentication

                        For authentication we use, server side firebase authentication. Means on client no need to load
                        big firebase library.

                        Hopefully in future firebase will use es6 modules for firebase.

                        ## REST API

                        We have REST API service for synchronising data, and updating data. Also for some live remote data.

                        For faster response time, we synchronise all data in background, but response to client coming from indexedDB.
                        There app will have same speed on slow networks, no networks or fast networks.

                        ## Firebase Realtime database

                        Firebase Realtime Database, is JSON related, and firebase are not supporting arrays, everything is an objects.
                        But because we want to use same API for firebase and indexedDB, need to treat firebase as key/value, but indexedDB everything as Objects.

                        In environment where is different storage mechanisms, to make possible use same codebase for server and client (service worker), need adapters.

                        In this case, we have adapter for firebase API. All methods in this adapter should be asynchronous, because any remote
                        access API is asynchronous by nature.

                        We injecting adapters in code implicitly, and then use inside in app.

                        P.S. Firebase introduced new database "Firestore" with new API, and better performance. In later stage we need to move on new database,
                        where will have new adapter.

                        One of challenges for indexedDB API, is not user friendly. There adapter will do two things, nicer API
                        and of course as adapter for our isomorphic app.

                        Need to know, indexedDB supporting arrays, but for comparability with firebase, need to store everything as objects.

                        ```javascript
                        ...

                        const objectStore = await  db.createObjectStore('userSession', {keyPath: 'idToken'});

                        const userMap = await objectStore('readonly');

                        const activeUserData = await userMap.get(token);
                        ...

                        ```

                        In this example, you can see, how to use same API in firebase and indexedDB.

                        In application, we use offline first approach. And in service worker API is sync event.
                        We simply hook to this event, and synchronise any time network is available.

                        ```javascript

                        Nodejs and Service Worker lazy router. Difference from other routers eg (express).
                        This router we will work in (express) and service workers.

                        First Router will take Request Object. All properties in request Object is available everywhere in app.
                        Request Object is not editable. All modified data, you add in response Object.



                        ```javascript

                            const req = {
                                db, //database with adapter
                                host, // host
                                body, // request body (optional)
                                next, // uri path
                                method, // method (GET,POST,PUT ...)
                                search // query params (optional)
                            }

                        ```

                        Then initialise router.
                        ```javascript
                        ...

                            const app = req => route.trigger(req)

                                .map(({req, resp}, res, rej) => !req.match ? rej() : res(resp))

                                .map(({content, contentType}) => ({content, contentType}))

                                .unsafeRun();

                        ```

                        ## Adapter examples

                        Example in express


                        ```javascript

                            express.use((req, res, next) => app(await prepareServerFetch(req)))

                                .then(({content}) => res.send(content))

                                .catch(() => next()));

                        ```

                        In service Workers

                        ```javascript

                            self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {

                                event.respondWith(new Promise(async (res) => {

                                    const {request} = event;

                                    const {cookie} = self;

                                    const req = await prepareClientFetch(request);

                                    app(req)

                                        .then(resp => res(new Response(resp.content, htmlHeader())))

                                        .catch(() => res(fetch(request)));

                                }));
                            });


                        ```

                        If router will find the route, respond back to client, custom content, else fetch original.
                        In express, could be REST or static assets, in service workers is good to test cache, before accessing network.

                        ## Models - data handlers

                        For app composition we use tasks from [functional](https://github.com/gunins/functional) library.
                        This app goals are composition, expressiveness and speed. Because tasks has `map` and `flatMap` methods
                        also `through` you can combine any combinations and transformations, in any step. All of them of course is
                        `async`.

                        Models in our app collecting data from remote server or local database, convert to required structure and
                        transfer in to next stage. Data, must be immutable, mostly everything is built in, but need to be aware,
                        if you doing your own transformations.

                        When you planning any application, most of the parts there is reusable. For any part in app, where is some
                        visible functionality, usually call widgets.

                        In our app any widget can be reusable in any place in app, and of course is immutable,
                        not conflicting with other components.

                        ## Organizing code

                        There is different ways to organise, we grouped by several sections.

                        - app - Main controller for application.
                        - Models - Models related to app.
                        - Pages - Page controllers each folder contains name of page, css file, template file which start with "_", controller usually start with capital letter, and client side javascript (we call it main.js).
                        - Widgets -  this folder is self explained. Widget internal structure is same as for page.
                        - lib - place for different common utilities / helpers.

                        Now we have several folders for different functionality on app.

                        - executors - This is folder for adapters, usually for Service Workers, Express for local test and firebase.
                        This is only place in app, where you adding client server adapters. Everywhere else you should use same code.
                        - rest - Folder for REST API, this is for server side only.
                        - client - global utilities for client side javascript.
                        - clodFunctions -  This folder is for cloud hook handling.

                        Sometimes is very difficult to unify codebase for Desktop/mobile. Good example is datepicker, mobile
                        has perfectly built in, desktop not looking so good. We have smart platform detector, and we can dynamically load
                        necessary files for Desktop, or mobile or tablet. Means on low end android phone you only execute javascript for
                        mobile, not any desktop related scripts.

                    ## Things to think before taking any framework

                    Use framework or not, is based on full app requirements, but most use cases you need html/css with some basic dom
                    handling, and nice css animations. Another requirements is charts. Most chart libraries are framework free.

                    But there is some use case where framework use should be handy. Plan your app this way, where you can use framework only in necessary app parts.

                    ## Splitting app in scopes

                    Sooner or later, in your app, growing functionality, this means app code will grow as well. To keep, app fast
                    and reliable, you still have some coding limits. Solution there is instead of one big app, split to smaller apps.
                    And when new functionality required, you can easy build new small app.

                    Usually, user use some part of all app, and not all in one go. If you will split your app, with smaller ones, and
                    use more than one Service Worker, this will make your code more modular, and keep your execution code reasonably small.
                    But to decide where and how to splitting the app, is depending on project requirements.

                    ## Older Browser Support

                    Of course important is to support older browsers, but need to check how much will cost for developers.
                    For browsers which ones are not supporting Service Workers, will use server side fetch, app will be slower,
                    but still usable.

                    ## Unit Tests

                    For all models, and queries related to database, I would recommend to use unit tests. Unit tests can cover up to 90%
                    of functionality in app. Then you can decide to use manual acceptance tests or some modern tools. This part is depending on costs.

                    In our development environment we are using standard development tools.

                    For our build we use Gulp, bundle builder is rollup, for testing Mocha, dependencies npm,
                    and firebase API for deploy.
