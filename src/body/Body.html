        <h2>StoneWall Javascript MVVM Framework</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Write less code, and keep in control. Stonewall is framework for creating large scalable single page
        applications. This framework includes features such as - Reusable Components, Routing, Data Binding to DOM
        Elements, UI auto updates and much more.</p>
    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>Standard HTML</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Rich templating structure is very close to standard html, plus all css in template is generated in unique way,
        and it's valid for this component only. Also in css can use less functionality, which is nice benefit.
        It's very easy to use for designers with no js knowledge. </p>
    <p>Also this making benefit, any component has own unique html, and css, and it's valid in any application,
        and not destructing other components.</p>
    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>Data First</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Data first approach allow framework to generate only required visible dom parts.
        This save initialisation time for application.
    </p>
    <p>Any response data, first is transformed to valid format and then compared with existing data,
        after changes are applied to existing dom elements, removed are removed, and missing is generated.
        Because only missing elements created and all the rest just change, this makes application very fast.
    </p>
    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>No direct Dom Access</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Stonewall not use direct dom access. All necessary dom elements is stored in object, and can be accessed in
        different stages.
        Like (elReady, when element is created, elOnChange when element binded data is changed, and adding events).
        This approach, allow to access only component elements, and components communicate to another components, by
        using eventBus.

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Before you start, you need some knowledge about <a href="http://requirejs.org" target="_blank">Requirejs</a>, <a
            href="https://css-tricks.com/modular-future-web-components/">Web Components</a>, HTML5 custom Element,

    <div class="title-h2">
        <h3>App Structure</h3>
    </div>

    <p>Application has two main classes, App and Constructor (Widget). App class will run application, and store
        context.
        Also creates EventBus, Router, and models. App handling all communication with Server. App also has access to
        Container(DOM Element). Important part is, in any Application only one </p>
    <p>Constructor (Widget) Class handling all DOM activities. For widgets are no limitations, they can be as many you
        want, and nested. Each Wdget has to be at least one DOM Element, or more. Any Widget can contain helpers, such
        as Styles, Components, Placeholders, Bindings and Routes. Below is detailed information about these
        components.</p>

    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>Styles</h4>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> In each template has Less css support. Any <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> tag
        supports any css or less. @import tags also supported, just need to use code <code>@{import-url}</code> before.
        Full example <code>>&lt;style&gt; @import "@{import-url}/_path_to_css.css"; &lt;/style&gt;</code>. Full info
        about Less
        <a href="http://lesscss.org/">there</a>. The key feature in templates is, your css are converted to unique
        classes,
        which ones applies only to your component. in this way you ne need to worrying about repeatable css class names.
        This approach is similar to HTML5 Shadow DOM.
    </p>

    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>Components</h4>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Components</strong> is AMD modules, means you can define in templates dynamic components.
        <code>&lt;cp-cpname src="pathtoCMP/Component" &gt;&lt;/cp-cpname&gt;</code> Where <code>Component</code> is AMD
        Javascript file.
        If Javascript file not necessary there is helper requirejs plugin <code>widget/parser!pathToComponent</code>
        in this case component can be plain javascript file.
    </p>

    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>Placeholders</h4>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Placeholders</strong> are elements which are define location in template. In template you use
        <code>&lt;pl-name&gt;&lt;/pl-name&gt;</code> There is two usages for placeholders.
        <strong>First:</strong> In Constructor you have access to this element by name.<br/>
        <strong>Second:</strong> You can define custom content for this placeholder from other templates. <br/>
        For example
        <code>&lt;cp-cpname src="pathtoCMP/Component" &gt;&lt;pl-name&gt;My custom content&lt;/pl-name&gt;&lt;/cp-cpname&gt;</code>
    </p>

    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>Bindings</h4>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Bindings</strong> Are used for bind Object data to dom element. in template you will use
        <code>&lt;bd-name tp-bind="bindName" &gt;&lt;/bd-name&gt;</code>. Bindings can be nested, also you can bind
        attributes as well <code>tp-bind-attrname="dataName"</code>. Bindings also support automatic object updates.
        In this case you need to add attribute <code>tp-update="true"</code>
    </p>

    <div class="title-h4">
        <h4>Routing</h4>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Routing</strong> are used to handle urls. Routing use <a href="https://github.com/gunins/urlmanager">UrlManager</a>
        to make single page applications easy to work with urls. Usage for routes
        <code>&lt;rt-rtname route="/home" &gt;&lt;div&gt;My custom content&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/rt-rtname&gt</code></p>
